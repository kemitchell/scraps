Inputs

  Publisher := ( name, email, password )

  Form := ( data )

  Edition_1 := ( publisher, project, edition, form digest )

  Edition_2 := ( publisher, project, edition, form digest, signatures )

  Edition_3 := (
    publisher, project, edition, form digest, signatures, settings )

  Annotation := (
    context form digest, specific form digest,
    optional annotation digest,
    publisher, timestamp, text,
    private flag )

Collections

  POST /forms -> "Repository"

  POST /projects -> referenced Form into "Library"

  Library is indexed.  Repository is not.

  Repository is "by specific request only".

Annotation Context

  Annotations have:

    1. A digest pointing to the _context_ in which they are relevant.

    2. A digest pointing to the _child_ of the context form (or the
       context form itself) for which they are relevant.

  Form A: ( B ( C ) D )
  Form X: ( Y Z C )

  (Form A, Form B, and Form X share C as a common child.)

  (C is a child of X, a child of B, and a grandchild of A.)

  Annotation 1: of C in the context of B
  Annotation 2: of C in the context of X
  Annotation 3: of C in its own context
  Annotation 4: of C in the context of A

  When viewing A:
    Annotation 1 --- C in B --- shown
    Annotation 2 --- C in X --- not shown
    Annotation 3 --- C in C --- shown
    Annotation 4 --- C in A --- shown

  When viewing B:
    Annotation 1 --- C in B --- shown
    Annotation 2 --- C in X --- not shown
    Annotation 3 --- C in C --- shown
    Annotation 4 --- C in A --- not shown

  When viewing C itself:
    Annotation 1 --- C in B --- not shown
    Annotation 2 --- C in X --- not shown
    Annotation 3 --- C in C --- shown
    Annotation 4 --- C in A --- not shown

  When viewing X:
    Annotation 1 --- C in B --- not shown
    Annotation 2 --- C in X --- shown
    Annotation 3 --- C in C --- shown
    Annotation 4 --- C in A --- not shown

  Generalized:

    Show an annotation of ( CHILD in PARENT )
    in the context of CONTEXT
    when both:

    1. CHILD is CONTEXT || CHILD is a child of CONTEXT

    2. PARENT is CONTEXT || PARENT is a child of CONTEXT

  Performance:

    This means running one query per child of a form to display.
