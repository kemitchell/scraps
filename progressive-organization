Progressive Organization

Introducing formal mechanisms of organization, such as a board of
directors, sometimes catalyzes better organization throughout.

    Some organization is often better than none.

    A certain degree of decorum inspires better behavior.

On the other hand:

    Organizational mechanisms introducted prospectively may not suit
    the organization, slow it down, or foment conflict.

    People may neglect or affirmatively reject mechanisms at odds wtih
    the ethos that otherwise inspires them to organize and cooperate.

To what extent are attempts to introduce organizational measures
reversible?

Principle: Avoid introducing organization in hard-to-reverse amounts.

"Progressive Organization" by analogy to "Progressive Enhancement"

Introduce formal mechanisms of organization only to the extent:

1. they are a valiadated fit for the organization

2. they represent a small-scope experiment in improving organization
   and will cost little to reverse in the near-to-medium term
