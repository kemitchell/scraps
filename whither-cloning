Whither Cloning?

In the olden days, AT&T or whoever would release software, and "The Community" would clone it.  To avoid all kinds of intellectual property issues.

These days, the BigCo is as likely to release the app-or-whatever under a "Community" license, but retain effective management and control of development.  Especially when the BigCo's "contribution" mostly boils down to ongoing work with a standards body, security concerns, &c., The Community really can't get itself together to provide a fungible replacement.
